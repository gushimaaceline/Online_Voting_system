# Online_Voting_system 
It's  a web app created  based on the state of my country Rwanda and some other East African countries which  still use the traditional voting system
of going to the voting sites, where the process normally last for more than three days to announce the winner because also counting votes it is done 
manually by people so it is easy for the mistakes to be made. So this system will reduce the wastage of time for the people and will reduce the mistakes 
from counting the votes.
